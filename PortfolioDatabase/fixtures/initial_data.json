      "hobby_desc": "Snowboarding is a winter sport in which you ride down a mountain on snow on a board with your feet strapped in.

      "hobby_paragraph": "Snowboarding is a thrilling winter sport that involves descending snow-covered slopes on a single board attached to the rider’s feet using specialized bindings. Unlike skiing, which uses two separate skis, snowboarding requires balance and coordination to maneuver the board by shifting body weight and using edge control. Riders can explore various styles, including freestyle (with tricks and jumps), alpine (focused on speed and carving), and backcountry (off-trail adventure). Originating in the 1960s and gaining popularity through the 1980s and 1990s, snowboarding has become a staple of winter sports culture and is featured in the Winter Olympics. It blends athleticism, creativity, and adrenaline in a way that appeals to both casual riders and competitive athletes."

      "hobby_paragraph": "Golf is a precision sport played on expansive outdoor courses, where players aim to hit a small ball into a series of holes using as few strokes as possible. Each course typically features 18 holes, with varying layouts that include fairways, sand traps, water hazards, and greens. Players use different types of clubs—drivers, irons, wedges, and putters—depending on the distance and terrain. The game emphasizes strategy, technique, and mental focus, as players must account for factors like wind, slope, and grass conditions. Originating in Scotland in the 15th century, golf has evolved into a global pastime with professional tours, iconic tournaments like The Masters, and a rich culture of etiquette and tradition."
